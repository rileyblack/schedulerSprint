# schedulerSprint
Linux-based C environment facilitating an efficiency competition between common CPU process scheduling methodologies. 

## Structure
Algorithm speeds are evaluated via process-filled queues which are constructed by parsing user-designed files describing scenarios of varying size/complexity. Results are published into a summary report.  

## Practical Take-Away Experience
* C
* CPU Process Scheduling
* Linux command-line environments
* Data Structures and Algorithms
* File Parsing
* Dynamic Allocation
