# schedulerSprint
Linux-based C environment facilitating an efficiency competition between common CPU process scheduling methodologies. Algorithm speeds are evaluated via process-filled queues which are constructed by parsing user-designed scenario files of varying size/complexity. Results are published to a summary report.
